Eloi Garandel / Kilian d'Eternod

Create a Jass (Swiss card game) game using Java.

### Launch the game

To start the game, launch `Javass` : a user interface will pop.

One can play alone versus IA player, serveral players can play on the same computers (versus IA or not) or online (but they have to be on the same locl network).
